# Safety

(draft description)  Both physical and psychological safety are critical for engaging and sustaining diverse participation. In the context of an open source project there are attributes that collectively signal and measure how safe a project is especially for under represented marginalized groups.  

## Metrics in this model

Below you will find a list of metrics categories, followed by CHAOSS metrics for measurement of each.   This is currently being developed and will be missing a few things especially data collection and reporting methods, but we will be working on that as part of the development process of this metrics model

### Communication Inclusivity
- Sentiment
- [Psychological Safety](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-dei/blob/main/focus-areas/project-and-community/psychological-safety.md)

### Inclusive Governance
- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-dei/blob/main/focus-areas/governance/code-of-conduct.md)
- [Code of Conduct Enforcement](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-dei/blob/main/focus-areas/governance/code-of-conduct-enforcement.md)
- Etiquette Guidelines (COming soon)
- [Equity and Trust](https://github.com/emmairwin/wg-dei/blob/main/focus-areas/governance/equity-trust.md) (Foundational)
- [GateKeeping/Inclusive Leadership](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-dei/blob/main/focus-areas/leadership/inclusive-leadership.md)
- [Known bad actors]() Does not exist yet as a metric, but worth thinking about.
