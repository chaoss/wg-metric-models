# Sustainability

Goal: We have a set of metrics and methods required to evaluate if a project is setup in a sustainable way.

# Some Potential User Stories


* As a potential consumer of an open-source package, I want to be able to evaluate how good a bet it is.
* As a maintainer or community leader for an open-source package, I want to maximize sustainability.
* As a product team evaluating the sustainability of our upstream projects to identify risk (and then to perhaps fund, hire someone etc)
* As a non-profit foundation/company giving program with a budget for funding open source, I want to identify those most in need, but I only want to support those who care about, or have goals for safety, equity and trust. (i.e. I donâ€™t want to give money to a toxic community).
* As a contributor, I want to join a project setup for success, and where I feel safe.


| Metric Model| Why this matters |
| --- | --- |
| [Safety](safety.md)|Historically under represented and margenlized people have been excluded and harmed as a direct result of their participation in open source. A project that does not prioritize the safety of participants (whether part of their paid role, or not) is a project and organizational risk.  Funding such projects may also risk reputation of sponsor, and potentially magnify that harm. |
| [Burnout Risk](burnout-risk.md)| A project with capacity risk (number of maintainers, availability of maintainers, time zones etc) is a huge risk.  |
| [Funding](funding.md)| project funding provides ability to out-source work (related to burn out), pay for services, as well as event travel, and costs of day to day life for those running a project.  The lack of support for each limits the quality and scaling potential for a project.|
| [Security](security.md)|  A project must be responsive and proactive for security,  the lack of which has potential for large-scale negative impact.|
