# Sustainability

Goal: We have a set of light-weight metrics and methods required to evaluate the very basic health of an open source project.

# Some Potential User Stories


* As a potential consumer of an open source project I want to evaluate the health of engagement around that project before ingesting/using.
* As someone contributing to open source, I want to assess the health of the project before I invest amy of my time there.
* As a maintainer of a project, I want to make sure that I have covered all of the basics to ensure my project is setup for success, and track that progress over time


| Metric Model| Why this matters |
| --- | --- |
| [Discovery](discovery.md)| How is this project discovered, and that experience.|
| [Responsiveness](responsiveness.md)| What do the mechanics of response to things like issues, PRs etc look like, and what is the sentiment/communication around that?  |
| [Contribution](contribution.md)| How is the project setup for contribution, what types, and who is contributing. |
| [Project-Design](project-design.md)| Does this project have the very basic setup to enable success (standards, governance etc)|
| [Usage](usage.md)| Who, where and why are people using this project.|
